This project is the implementation of a basic bluetooth app controlled switch. 

We'll be sending specific commands through android application using bluetooth communication to control household appliances.

You can use any bluetooth terminal app available on playstore to send commands.
But, if you want to make an application yourself we've also provide you details.

Refer the connections document and the code for more explanation.
