This project is a demonstration about how to control a car using a cell phone. 
We use the DTMF (dual tone multi frequency) signals from the cell phone that we generated you press any key in the phone.
Pressing the key generated two tones from of different frequencies.

In this project, we have used Arduino to read those signals and coded the bot to follow the commands as per the tone transmitted.
For eg pressing 2 key will command bot to move forward, pressing 8 will back ward and so on so forth.

One phone is connected to the Arduino with an audio jack, we receive the signals and process it accordingly. 
You can call to that phone from any number from anywhere in the world and control the bot.

Future scope:
Add a wireless camera in the bot so that controlling the bot becomes easy from remote places.
