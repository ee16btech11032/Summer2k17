In this project we are demonstrating biometric voting machine using arduinio

In this project we take the raw input from the fingerprint sensor and covert it into a digital output and stores it in a database 
this process is called registration .for this we require laptop,arduino,and fingerprint sensor. 

once the registration is finished .his\her will be able to cast their vote at the polling booths.

during casting their vote, arduino validates for the match of this fingerprint with the one in registration database .
if it finds your fingerprint your vote will be casted.

ADVANTAGES

Providing the preventive measures system for voting.
It cannot provide any chance to invalid votes.
It reduces the timing of polling.
At the counting centers, it can provide easy and accurate counting without any troubles.
